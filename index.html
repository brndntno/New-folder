	<h2>
        Chinese Poker, a card game in which 52 cards are distributed among
        4 players, is won when a player discards all 13 of their cards. Hands
        are played in 1s, 2s, 3s, and 5s, where hierarchy is determined via
        the rank or suit of the card(s).

        <h3>1s & 2s</h3>
        <p>
            When playing 1 or 2 cards in Chinese Poker, hierarchy is determined 
            via the rank or suit of the card(s). Rank has precedence over suit, however, 
            so if one were to play a pair of 7s of spades and hearts, a pair of 8s of 
            clubs and diamonds would trump it. Only when cards of the same rank are played 
            does suit matter: if one player played a queen of hearts and another played 
            a queen of spades, the queen of spades would trump.

        <h3>3s</h3>
        <p>
            Playing 3 cards is similar to playing 1 and 2, but suit carries no 
            weight because there are only 4 cards of each rank in a deck of 52. 
            Therefore, precedence is determined solely on rank. A trio of aces would 
            trump a trio of kings.

        <h3>5s</h3>
        <p>
            Straight Flush: When playing 5 cards, a straight flush is the highest type 
            of hand you can play, and it is composed of 5 consecutvely ranked cards of the 
            same suit. ex. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in which each card is a heart suited one. 
            Precedence is determined by the hand with the highest ranked card, but if 
            two hands share the same highest rank, precedence is determined via the 
            hierarchy of the suits. 
            Four of a Kind: The 2nd highest type of 5 carded hand, a four of a kind  is 
            composed of 4 cards of the same rank and a random card. Precedence is determined 
            by the hand with 4 cards of higher rank. 
            Full House: The next type of hand in hierarchy, a full house is composed of 
            a trio and a pair of cards. ex. 8, 8, 8, 5, 5 
            Precedence is determined via the hand with the higher trio of cards. 
            Flush: The 2nd lowest type of 5 carded hand, a flush is composed of 5 cards 
            of the same suit, where precedence is determined via the hand composed of the 
            higher suit. ex. 5 cards of spades would trump 5 cards of hearts 
            Straight: The lowest type of 5 carded hand, a straight is composed of 5 
            consecutive cards in rank. ex. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
            Precedence is determined via the hand with the higher highest ranked card.
